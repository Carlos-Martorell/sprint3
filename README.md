# ðŸŽ¬ SPRINT 3 â€“ Movie Data Processing with JavaScript & Jest

This repository is part of the IT Academy Bootcamp and corresponds to **Sprint 3**, focused on mastering JavaScript array methods and unit testing with **Jest**.

---

## ðŸ§° Required Software

To run and complete the project, the following tools are required:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) â€“ for automated testing
- [Jest HTML Reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-html-reporter) â€“ to visualize test results in the browser

### ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
npm install
npm install --save-dev jest jest-html-reporter
```

ðŸ§ª Methodology
This sprint follows the principle of "programming to satisfy tests", where each function is implemented to pass the predefined test suite (films.spec.js). Console output is avoided in favor of test validation.
All functions are designed with:
âœ… Single Responsibility Principle
âœ… Readable and maintainable code
âœ… Efficient use of array methods

ðŸ”€ Branch Workflow
A structured Git workflow has been followed using feature-based branches:
Branch Name	Purpose
main	Final, stable version of the sprint
developer	Active development and integration testing
feature/level1	Implementation of mandatory exercises
feature/level2	Implementation of optional exercise 7
feature/level3	Implementation of optional exercise 8

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
JavaScript (ES6)
Node.js
Jest (unit testing)
Git & GitHub (version control)
